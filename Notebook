Introduction
Traffic collision is one of the leading causes of death all around the world. With this in mind we need to predict severity of occurences based on a range of factors collected from several years. This document is focused on the city of Seattle, where we have an historical set of data ready to be analysed.

With the output of the predictions here, government institutions can plan improvements around Seattle roads and general urban growth with more attention to the most critical areas, deciding where to construct hospitals or policy bases for faster response to occurences.

Insurance companies can also benefit from these insights to provide more tailored services, allowing them to rate new clients, giving discount or charging more based on the are they live.
